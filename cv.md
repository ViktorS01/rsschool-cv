I really love to develop new skills. It's interesting for me to work on myself. I especially like to work on common projects.  
From high school I became interested in programming. During this time, I managed to get acquainted with many languages, but I was especially interested in: *Java, Java Script, Python, C*.  
I have experience with databases such as MySQL.  
I especially enjoy doing **web** programming: using **HTML, CSS, JS**.  
While studying at the university, I completed many projects, for example, playing on a game engine Unity using C#.  
Several sites with their own layouts.  
Also, a lot of program code is written in the language Java.  
At the moment I am studying at the University of SSTU.
